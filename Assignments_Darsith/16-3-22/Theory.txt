1) What are the predifined functions in collection in java?
add(Object) -> To add an object to the collection.
addAll(Collection c) ->To adds all the elements in the given collection to this collection.
clear() -> To removes all of the elements from this collection.
contains(Object o) -> To returns true if the collection contains the specified element.
containsAll(Collection c) -> To returns true if the collection contains all of the elements in the given collection.
equals(Object o) -> To compares the specified object with this collection for equality.
hashCode() -> To return the hash code value for this collection.
isEmpty() -> To true if this collection contains no elements.
iterator() -> To returns an iterator over the elements in this collection.
max() -> To return the maximum value present in the collection.
parallelStream() -> To returns a parallel Stream with this collection as its source.
remove(Object o) -> To remove the given object from the collection. If there are duplicate values, then this method removes the first occurrence of the object.
removeAll(Collection c)	-> To remove all the objects mentioned in the given collection from the collection.
removeIf(Predicate filter) -> To remove all the elements of this collection that satisfy the given predicate.
retainAll(Collection c)	-> To retain only the elements in this collection that are contained in the specified collection.
size() -> To return the number of elements in the collection.
spliterator() -> To create a Spliterator over the elements in this collection.
stream() -> To return a sequential Stream with this collection as its source.
toArray() -> To return an array containing all of the elements in this collection.
		
2) What are the underlying ds for linked list arraylist in java?
Both ArrayList and LinkedList are two different implementations of the List interface. ArrayList is a resizable-array implementation, whereas LinkedList is a Doubly linked list implementation of the List interface.

3) What are the advantages and disadvatages of array list?

Advantages:
-Retrieval is faster in ArrayList
-ArrayList is variable length.
-Add any type of data into ArrayList.
-Can traverse in both directions.
-Insert and remove elements also at particular position of ArrayList.
-ArrayList allows multiple null values.
-ArrayList allows to add duplicate elements.
-ArrayList has many methods to manipulate stored objects.
-When ArrayList exceeds its capacity, then its size increases by 50%.

Disadvantages:
-If a data entry is added to or removed from an array-based list, data needs to be shifted to update the list.
-Holds only object types and not primitive
types

4) What are iterators and cursors?
An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet.
Java Cursor is an Iterator, which is used to iterate or traverse or retrieve a Collection or Stream object's elements one by one.

5) What are the 10 owasp?
Injection
Broken Authentication
Sensitive Data Exposure
XML External Entities (XXE)
Broken Access Control
Security Misconfiguration
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Insecure Deserialization.
Using components with known vulnerabilities
Insufficient logging and monitoring

6) Can catch be returned without try?
No, We can't have catch or finally clause without a try statement.

7) Can try be return catch in java?
Whenever try-block executes successfully, then it can always return value for this method
from try-block. But if any exception is raised then it is NOT handled as there is no catch-block
for this case.

8) Can finally be return without try catch in java?
A finally block must be associated with a try block, you cannot use finally without a try block. 

9)diffarence b/w comparable and comparator in java?

Comparable:-
1) Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. In other words, 
we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.
2) Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.
3) Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.
4) Comparable is present in java.lang package.	
5) We can sort the list elements of Comparable type by Collections.sort(List) method.

Comparator:-
1)The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
2)Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
3)Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.
4)A Comparator is present in the java.util package.
5)We can sort the list elements of Comparator type by Collections.sort(List, Comparator) method.
